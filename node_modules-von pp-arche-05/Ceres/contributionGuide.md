# Ceres Contribution Guide

## So you want to contribute to the development of Ceres?

Ceres is an open source project. As a part of our community, you can add features, help fix bugs, or improve our codebase. To do so, you will need to open a pull request on GitHub, which we will then assess and, if everything is all right, approve and merge.
If you want to contribute to our project, proceed as described below.
Thanks a lot for being a part of our community!


## How to do it

1. Fork the Ceres repository on GitHub by clicking the **Fork** button in the upper right corner.
2. [Clone](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) the forked repository.
3. Create a new **branch** on which you will implement your changes. 
4. Make your changes (e.g. a bug fix) in the cloned repository.
5. Once you are done, **commit** your changes to the branch you created.
6. Create a pull request. Always create pull requests against our **stable** branch!
7. Mention **@plentymarkets-ceres-io** in the description of your pull request.
8. Add 2-3 sentences that describe the changes you've made in the description of the pull request.


## Branch naming

The branches you create should follow the following naming convention:
- Branches for bug fixes should always begin with the prefix **fix** and a slash, e.g. "fix/sticky_container_div".
- Branches for features should always begin with the prefix **feature** and a slash, e.g. "feature/order_details_popup".

If your changes require **beta** or **early**, please indicate this by adding a corresponding **beta** or **early** tag to your pull requests.
